# Titanic Dataset Analysis and Classification

This project explores the Titanic dataset through a combination of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and classification modeling. We preprocess the data, perform feature engineering, and apply various classification algorithms to predict survival outcomes.

### Project Structure

- **EDA_Titanic**: Contains the data preprocessing steps, including feature selection, scaling, and encoding. This section prepares the dataset for effective modeling.

- **LinearModels**: Tests the processed data on various linear models to assess performance and suitability for the classification task.

- **DecisionTrees**: Applies decision tree algorithms to classify data, analyzing model accuracy and interpretability.
